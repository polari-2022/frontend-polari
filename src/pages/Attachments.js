                            Our attachment style refers to how we responded and related to our parents when we were children and how similar attachment styles tend to form in our romantic relationships as adults. This is called attachment theory.

                            Attachment styles are divided into three distinct groups: secure, anxious, and avoidant. Research shows that around 50 percent of adults are secure, 20 percent are anxious, 25 percent are avoidant, and the remaining fall into the least common combination of both anxious and avoidant called fearful-avoidant.

                        <h2>Anxious Attachment</h2>
                        <p>
                            Anxious individuals crave intimacy but are worried that their partner will not reciprocate their level of commitment and emotional connection. They tend to be hypervigilant and sensitive about their partner's mood and behavior and often seek a lot of reassurance. The anxiously attached can also be seen as "needy" at times and have a strong fear of abandonment.
                        </p>

                            Awareness of your needs and anxieties in a relationship can be helpful to identify and then communicate them, as well as, using self-soothing techniques and creating boundaries when needed. Be consious of putting people on a pedestal, keeping score, and protest behavior.

                        <h2>Avoidant Attachment</h2>
                        <p>
                            Avoidant individuals see themselves as having high levels of independence and self-sufficiency. They have a fear of being controlled by others, as well as a deep fear of rejection. They often feel they donâ€™t need close relationships and feel uncomfortable with too much closeness, and may find ways to sabotage them when they develop. At times of conflict, they tend to run away or avoid the problem. People with avoidant attachment styles do crave intimacy but tend to push others away with negative thoughts about relationships.

                                        Secure attachment styles are those where an individual feels comfortable depending on others and having others depend on them. They have a positive view of themselves and their partners. Secure individuals are comfortable with intimacy but also don't fear being on their own.
